# Abstract

The Ethereum blockchain is starting to become more utilised compared to recent years. Especially with its recent system upgrade known as the merge which cuts down its high energy usage. Nowadays, the most popular type of applications is centralised based applications. Dynamically generated data either gets written to a non-relational database or a relational one that stores data within tables. However, there is a difference between decentralised and centralised applications. In decentralised systems, every single transaction gets placed into the blockchain which is a publicly accessible distributed ledger. Anybody in the world has access to the blockchain database. Its immutability nature renders its data highly secure and reliable. Nowadays, as there are more and more events being organised and hosted by individuals, there are a couple of critical problems that we face. One of them being event tickets being tampered and the second one being replicated and counterfeited versions.
